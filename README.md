# Braille_Text_Art_Left_Right_Inverter
Inverts an Braille Unicode text drawing given as input, left-to-write. Also does character substitutions of the braille dots, since not all Braille Unicode characters are symmetric. (Created because I wanted to flip some text art, and was unsatisfied with text converters I found online)
